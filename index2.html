<p>Just in time for increased hospitalizations due to Covid and the flu season, <a href="https://go.nationalnursesunited.org/go/333106?t=6&ak_proof=1&akid=840407%2E618336%2EjydiMe">Hospital Leadership is going to jeopardize your license and undermine safe patient care with cuts to incentives for safe staffing</a>, including an $80 cut--equal to a 20% cut--to RN critical staffing pay, a $600 cut--equal to a 25% cut--to the RN extra shift bonus program, and cuts to safe staffing incentives for Pharmacy, Therapy, Respiratory, Surgical Techs, Imaging Techs, Paramedics, LPNs, Lab Techs, Monitor Techs, Nursing/Patient Care Techs and Constant Observers, effective November 12, 2023.</p><p>These new cuts are in ADITTION to the safe staffing incentive cuts the Hospitals implemented on August 20, less than three months ago.  Combined, these cuts represent a 40% cut in safe staffing incentives: cutting Critical Staffing Pay from $530 to $320 per shift, and cutting Extra Shift Bonus Committment contracts from $3,000 to $1,800.</p>
<p>Rather than having your back and supporting you to care for your patients, the Hospital's decision to cut staffing will create conditions that discourage nurses and other healthcare professionals from working extra shifts due to increased workloads, burnout, exhaustion and illness.  Shockingly, leadership expects you to normalize this practice and jeopardize your license by subjecting yourself to these dangerous conditions. </p>
<p>It doesn't need to be this way.</p>

<p>In the event the Hospital implements these cuts, remember to protect your job and your license by reporting safety concerns and complete an ADO to document your advocacy for your patient.  If you need ADOs or have any questions, contact Henry Soria, NNOC Labor Representative, by phone at (702) 496-0992 or email at hsoria@nnoc.net--and remember to send copies of your completed ADOs to Henry by text at (702) 496-0992.</p><img src="https://go.nationalnursesunited.org/o.gif?akid=840407.618336.jydiMe&ak_proof=1" alt=""/>
